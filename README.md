# ApplePie
“Apple Pie is a simple word-guessing game, where the user must guess a word, letter by letter, before all the apples fall off of the apple tree. If there are apples remaining, the user wins—and can eat delicious Apple Pie.” Excerpt From: Apple Education. “Develop in Swift Fundamentals.” Apple Inc. - Education, 2020.
